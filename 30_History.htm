<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: History</h1>

<h2>A (Very) Brief History of the BioAPI Reference Implementation</h2>

<ul>

<li><b>July 13-15, 2000</b>

<p>First development workshop, hosted by <a href="http://www.bioscrypt.com/">Bioscrypt</a> (formerly Mytec).

<p><li><b>August 22-23, 2000</b>

<p>Second development workshop, hosted by <a href="http://www.saflink.com/">SAFLINK</a>.

<p><li><b>September 13, 2000</b>

<p>Version 1.0beta1 of the reference implementation released.

<p><li><b>December 20, 2000</b>

<p>Updates for the Version 1.0beta2 of the reference implementation sent to the reference implementation mailing list.

<p><li><b>January 16, 2001</b>

<p>Version 1.0beta2 of the reference implementation released.

<p><li><b>February 19, 2001</b>

<p>Version 1.01 of the reference implementation released.

<p><li><b>March 16, 2001</b>

<p>Version 1.10 of the reference implementation released.

<p><li><b>March ??, 2002</b>

<p>Version 1.11 of the reference implementation released.  Changes include:

<ul>
<li>merged in changes made to CDSA release 3.14 (mainly improved portability, some bug fixes)
<li>fixed Response parameter in GUI callback functions to be a pointer
<li>updated Perl scripts and input files to generate correct output
<li>fixed bugs dealing with non-zero device IDs
<li>fixed dynamic device insert/remove issue
<li>fix to allow multiple devices to be registered under a single module
<li>improved this HTML documentation, particularly building and installation
<li>improved password BSP and sample app to be better examples of "the right way"
</ul>

<p>Any application which uses the GUI callback functions will be incompatible
between version 1.10 and 1.11.  However, since the callbacks could not operate
as intended in version 1.10, it is expected that this will have little impact.
Other applications will be able to work identically with both versions.

</ul>
